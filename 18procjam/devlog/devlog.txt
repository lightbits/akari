-----------------
Added shooting enemies and ability to shoot. Enemies move in a boring pattern though. Lasers can be arbitrarily placed on bodies.

-----------------
Added dynamic enemy behaviours. Now you can specify some path for an enemy to follow, when to shoot bullets, animated, and so on. This will become useful later, when I add the procedural enemy generation. My intention is to generate these routines procedurally, in some interesting fashion.
